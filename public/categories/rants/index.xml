      <description>Whenever I have spare time ( often around Christmas or when I&amp;rsquo;m on vacation/traveling ), I tend to fill it with working on projects I&amp;rsquo;ve built up in my backlog. I&amp;rsquo;m also really trying to keep a continuous streak of OSS commits going on Github (something about filling that chart up makes me want to work harder). Here&amp;rsquo;s my process and how I go about working on personal projects and try to stay motivated - if you have any ideas I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them in the comments!</description>
