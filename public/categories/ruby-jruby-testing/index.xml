      <description>Testing is one of the most important parts of software development and helps to ensure bugs don&amp;rsquo;t get into production and that code can be refactored safely. If you&amp;rsquo;re working on a team with multiple people with different skill sets, you might have people doing testing who only know windows and development is only using OSX or Linux. We want everyone to be able to test - someone in QA who is familiar with Windows shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to throw away all that knowledge, install Linux, and start from scratch.</description>
