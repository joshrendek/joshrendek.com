      <h1 class="title"> CentOS GCC not found &#43; other weird errors after hdd cloned </h1>
      <div class="content"> <p>A week or so ago the HDD started failing on my web server, so I had the DC clone the HDD for me. Some files however got lost in transit (bad sectors) and when I was trying to install nginx to get some testing done, I kept getting this error:</p>

<pre>./configure
C compiler not found
</pre>

<p>Apparently it wasn&rsquo;t finding GCC, even though it was definitely installed. After looking around a bit at the system and talking with a few people on IRC #linux, found out that some header files and other files were missing from /usr/include. Here is an example of some of the errors  I got with a simple hello world C++ program:</p>

<pre lang="cpp">

<p>The solution was to go to another server (which I have several) of the same architecture, and SCP (or rsync, take your pick) the /usr/include directory over.</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>
