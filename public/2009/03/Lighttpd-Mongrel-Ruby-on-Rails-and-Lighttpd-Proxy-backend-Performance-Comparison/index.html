      <h1 class="title"> Lighttpd, Mongrel, Ruby on Rails, and Lighttpd Proxy backend Performance Comparison </h1>
      <div class="content"> <p>First I was kind of surprised at the lack of performance comparisons people have made between the different lighttpd proxies with a rails/mongrel cluster backend and which ones would be best.</p>

<p>Lets start off the the specs of the box:
Intel Atom 330 CPU
Standard 7,200RPM HDD
CentOS 5.2
2GB Ram
Lighttpd with 3 Mongrel Clusters running an online food ordering system I wrote (MySQL + Rails)</p>

<p>Other than that there was nothing special. I&rsquo;ve done no kernel tweaking or any other performance optimizations with Lighttpd or any other part of the system.</p>

<p>Result Data / Proxy Type /  Result
<h2>Requests Per Second</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/requests-per-second.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-189" title="requests-per-second lighttpd rails mongrel cluster" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/requests-per-second.png" alt="requests-per-second lighttpd rails mongrel cluster" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash           21.41
Round-Robin 39.73
First   40.07</p>

<p>Hash is the loser in the proxy test over all. The requests per second capabilities of it were nearly half of what Round-Robin and First were able to achieve with the 3 node mongrel cluster running in the background. This is to be expected though since the Hash algorithm (so far as I understand it) will send the same url requests to the same proxy to help caching, whereas round-robin and first proxy methods balance it over the 3 nodes (or however many you have running).
<h2>Total Time Taken</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/time-taken.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-190" title="time-taken" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/time-taken.png" alt="time-taken" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    467.20772
Round-Robin 251.725273
First   249.578092</p>

<p>Round-Robin are nearly neck and neck with the total time taken to return 10,000 hits with 250 concurrency, while the hash algorithm still lags far behind.
<h2>Transfer Rate</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/transfer-rate.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191" title="transfer-rate" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/transfer-rate.png" alt="transfer-rate" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    59.74
Round-Robin 110.84
First   111.79</p>

<p>Since only one mongrel cluster is able to serve all the requests in Hash, where as 3 are able to in the Round Robin and First tests, the transfer rate is much higher. I&rsquo;m sure this could have been improved even further had I put all static files like style sheets and images on a separate instance so Mongrel could just worry about the rails files instead of rails + static, but since this site only has about 5 or so images, I did not think it necessary.
<h2>Longest Request</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/longest-request.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-192" title="longest-request" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/longest-request.png" alt="longest-request" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    22795
Round-Robin 17132
First   11936</p>

<p>This is the result data where First comes through, beating Round Robin by a good portion (~6 seconds) and proving to be the quickest to serve up the website.
<h2>Load Averages</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/load-avg.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" title="load-avg" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/load-avg.png" alt="load-avg" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    1.15
Round-Robin 3.15
First   3.28</p>

<p>Since Hash is only using one mongrel cluster instance, instead of the 3, the CPU load was much lower. However, Round Robin and First were very close, but I believe that when comparing the request times for First and Round Robin, First is worth the <em>very</em> miniscule increase in server load.
<h3>Notes on Apache + Passenger + Mod_Rails + Phusion mumbo jumbo</h3>
I&rsquo;m not going to claim to be an Apache expert, but one thing I&rsquo;m positive about is Apache&rsquo;s slowness&hellip;. with everything. I go nuts when pages don&rsquo;t load fast because of server software and when I tried out Phusion Passenger / Mod Rails and apache (whatever you want to call it)&hellip; even with Enterprise ruby installed, it was still incredibly slow (noticable to me while just randomly hitting refresh).</p>

<p>While Phusion makes deploying rails apps a bit simpler / easier to add new apps, in the long run I view it as detrimental should your application ever grow. The reason I chose to work with mongrel and Lighttpd (although Nginx is another viable option) is because I looked at sites like GitHub and EngineYard (a large rails host) and checked a few of their web server headers and found them to be running Nginx (with a Mongrel backend I&rsquo;m assuming).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about memory I did not notice much of a difference between what my application used while in Phusion vs Mongrel, but one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HUGE</strong></span> differences I did notice was when running <code>ab -n 1000 -c 10</code> the load would shoot up to 5, while Lighttpd&rsquo;s would barely hit .89. I didn&rsquo;t bother attempting <code>ab -n 10000 -c 250</code> with apache since I didn&rsquo;t want the box to melt/halt/be-killed-by-apache. If load isn&rsquo;t an issue and you&rsquo;re a die-hard Apache fan, stick with Phusion, but my tests put it <em>way</em> behind Lighttpd+Mongrel in comparison.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions for other analytic&rsquo;s to test let me know! I&rsquo;d love to do some more research regarding this and post my findings since there seems to be a lack of them on google.</p>
