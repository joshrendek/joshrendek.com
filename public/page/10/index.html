      <h1 class="title"> <a href='https://joshrendek.com/2009/03/lighttpd-mongrel-ruby-on-rails-and-lighttpd-proxy-backend-performance-comparison/'> Lighttpd, Mongrel, Ruby on Rails, and Lighttpd Proxy backend Performance Comparison</a> </h1>
      <div class="content"> <p>First I was kind of surprised at the lack of performance comparisons people have made between the different lighttpd proxies with a rails/mongrel cluster backend and which ones would be best.</p>

<p>Lets start off the the specs of the box:
Intel Atom 330 CPU
Standard 7,200RPM HDD
CentOS 5.2
2GB Ram
Lighttpd with 3 Mongrel Clusters running an online food ordering system I wrote (MySQL + Rails)</p>

<p>Other than that there was nothing special. I&rsquo;ve done no kernel tweaking or any other performance optimizations with Lighttpd or any other part of the system.</p>

<p>Result Data / Proxy Type /  Result
<h2>Requests Per Second</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/requests-per-second.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-189" title="requests-per-second lighttpd rails mongrel cluster" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/requests-per-second.png" alt="requests-per-second lighttpd rails mongrel cluster" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash           21.41
Round-Robin 39.73
First   40.07</p>

<p>Hash is the loser in the proxy test over all. The requests per second capabilities of it were nearly half of what Round-Robin and First were able to achieve with the 3 node mongrel cluster running in the background. This is to be expected though since the Hash algorithm (so far as I understand it) will send the same url requests to the same proxy to help caching, whereas round-robin and first proxy methods balance it over the 3 nodes (or however many you have running).
<h2>Total Time Taken</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/time-taken.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-190" title="time-taken" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/time-taken.png" alt="time-taken" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    467.20772
Round-Robin 251.725273
First   249.578092</p>

<p>Round-Robin are nearly neck and neck with the total time taken to return 10,000 hits with 250 concurrency, while the hash algorithm still lags far behind.
<h2>Transfer Rate</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/transfer-rate.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191" title="transfer-rate" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/transfer-rate.png" alt="transfer-rate" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    59.74
Round-Robin 110.84
First   111.79</p>

<p>Since only one mongrel cluster is able to serve all the requests in Hash, where as 3 are able to in the Round Robin and First tests, the transfer rate is much higher. I&rsquo;m sure this could have been improved even further had I put all static files like style sheets and images on a separate instance so Mongrel could just worry about the rails files instead of rails + static, but since this site only has about 5 or so images, I did not think it necessary.
<h2>Longest Request</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/longest-request.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-192" title="longest-request" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/longest-request.png" alt="longest-request" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    22795
Round-Robin 17132
First   11936</p>

<p>This is the result data where First comes through, beating Round Robin by a good portion (~6 seconds) and proving to be the quickest to serve up the website.
<h2>Load Averages</h2>
<a href="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/load-avg.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193" title="load-avg" src="http://bluescripts.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/load-avg.png" alt="load-avg" width="451" height="271" /></a></p>

<p>Hash    1.15
Round-Robin 3.15
First   3.28</p>

<p>Since Hash is only using one mongrel cluster instance, instead of the 3, the CPU load was much lower. However, Round Robin and First were very close, but I believe that when comparing the request times for First and Round Robin, First is worth the <em>very</em> miniscule increase in server load.
<h3>Notes on Apache + Passenger + Mod_Rails + Phusion mumbo jumbo</h3>
I&rsquo;m not going to claim to be an Apache expert, but one thing I&rsquo;m positive about is Apache&rsquo;s slowness&hellip;. with everything. I go nuts when pages don&rsquo;t load fast because of server software and when I tried out Phusion Passenger / Mod Rails and apache (whatever you want to call it)&hellip; even with Enterprise ruby installed, it was still incredibly slow (noticable to me while just randomly hitting refresh).</p>

<p>While Phusion makes deploying rails apps a bit simpler / easier to add new apps, in the long run I view it as detrimental should your application ever grow. The reason I chose to work with mongrel and Lighttpd (although Nginx is another viable option) is because I looked at sites like GitHub and EngineYard (a large rails host) and checked a few of their web server headers and found them to be running Nginx (with a Mongrel backend I&rsquo;m assuming).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re worried about memory I did not notice much of a difference between what my application used while in Phusion vs Mongrel, but one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HUGE</strong></span> differences I did notice was when running <code>ab -n 1000 -c 10</code> the load would shoot up to 5, while Lighttpd&rsquo;s would barely hit .89. I didn&rsquo;t bother attempting <code>ab -n 10000 -c 250</code> with apache since I didn&rsquo;t want the box to melt/halt/be-killed-by-apache. If load isn&rsquo;t an issue and you&rsquo;re a die-hard Apache fan, stick with Phusion, but my tests put it <em>way</em> behind Lighttpd+Mongrel in comparison.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions for other analytic&rsquo;s to test let me know! I&rsquo;d love to do some more research regarding this and post my findings since there seems to be a lack of them on google.</p>

      <div class="content"> <p>I&rsquo;m going to keep updating this post as I make some more findings about Rails that I think are pretty good assumptions a newbie should learn about:</p>

<p><strong>Case 2, forms: </strong>
I made an array using split(&ldquo;,&rdquo;) in the controller, then in the view I was looping through and could puts them out fine, however the ultimate goal was to use them in a form. Basically I needed it to be name=&ldquo;order[field_name]&rdquo; name=&ldquo;order[field_name_2]&rdquo;</p>

<p>GOOD Code to do this:
&lt;% for c in @customize_this %&gt;
        &lt;%= form.check_box :&ldquo;#{c}&rdquo; %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</p>

<p>However I had originally gotten name=&ldquo;order[c]&rdquo; name=&ldquo;order[c]&rdquo; - basically the same thing for all items in the list&hellip;
The BAD code was this:
&lt;% for c in @customize_this %&gt;
        &lt;%= form.check_box :c %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</p>

<p>Best place to read more about it: <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Case 1, links:</strong>
Good: <b>&lt;%= link_to &ldquo;#{item.name}&rdquo;, :action =&gt; &ldquo;customize&rdquo;, :id =&gt; item.id %&gt;</b><br>
Bad:            <b>&lt;%= link_to &ldquo;#{item.name}&rdquo;, :action =&gt; &ldquo;customize/#{item.id}&rdquo; %&gt;</b><br></p>

      <div class="content"> <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to finally tackle learning rails by developing my next project in it.</p>

<p>However I was setting up Ruby/Rails when trying to run gem install rails returned this error:</p>

<p>/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in
`gem_original_require&rsquo;: no such file to load &ndash; zlib (LoadError)</p>

<p>After I ran yum install zlib* and hit yes to the devel libraries, went back to ruby source, did make clean, ./configure, make, make install then switched to the ruby gem source and ran ruby setup.rb and then gem install rails worked fine.</p>

<p>I was actually at Panera&rsquo;s doing some work while I ate breakfast with a friend when I did this&hellip; I had planned on staying longer but apparently Panera&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t like customers buying lunch&hellip; I had planned on staying an additional bit past 12 to eat some lunch there but was promptly disconnected from the internet after 30 minutes of use (between 11:30AM and 1:30PM they block you after 30 minutes of WiFi).</p>

Copy the lighttpd conf to somewhere easy to find:
<div class="console">cp doc/lighttpd.conf /home/lighttpd.conf</div>
<div class="console">make
make install</div>
Now onto PHP:
<div class="console">yum install php</div>
That&rsquo;s done easily enough. Verify it&rsquo;s installed:
<div class="console">root@localhost lighttpd-1.4.20]# php -v
PHP 5.1.6 (cli) (built: Jul 16 2008 19:53:00)
Copyright &copy; 1997-2006 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.1.0, Copyright &copy; 1998-2006 Zend Technologies</div>
Verify python&rsquo;s installed:
<div class="console">[root@localhost lighttpd-1.4.20]# python
Python 2.4.3 (#1, May 24 2008, 13:47:28)
[GCC 4.1.2 20070626 (Red Hat 4.1.2-14)] on linux2
Type &ldquo;help&rdquo;, &ldquo;copyright&rdquo;, &ldquo;credits&rdquo; or &ldquo;license&rdquo; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
(hit ctrl+d to exit the python interpreter)</p>

<p>Install MySQL:
<div class="console">yum install mysql*</div>
( I just install them all as this is a dev server anyways )</p>

<p>Everything went okay so now onto Ruby
<div class="console">yum install ruby*</div>
Everything went okay, and all the software is installed. Now it&rsquo;s time to configure them.</p>

<p><strong>First lets get PHP working with Lighty.</strong>
<div class="console">nano /etc/php.ini</div>
hit CTRL+V to page down real quick&hellip;. at the bottom of the file add:
<div class="console">cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1</div>
Save the file and exit.</p>

<p>First:
<div class="console">whereis php-cgi</div>
It should be in /usr/bin/php-cgi</p>

<p>Second:
<div class="console">adduser dev</div>
<div class="console">echo &ldquo; &gt;&gt; /home/dev/index.php</div>
Now lets open lighttpd.conf
<div class="console">nano /home/lighttpd.conf</div>
Un-comment the fastcgi, rewrite, and redirect lines.</p>

<p>Lets change the document root to be /home/dev/</p>

<p>Lets also make sure we change the user of Lighty:
<div class="console">## change uid to  (default: don&rsquo;t care)
server.username            = &ldquo;dev&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="change-uid-to-default-don-t-care">change uid to  (default: don&rsquo;t care)</h2>

<p>server.groupname           = &ldquo;dev&rdquo;</div>
Now scroll down and add this to the bottom:
<div class="console">fastcgi.server = ( &ldquo;.php&rdquo; =&gt; ((
&ldquo;bin-path&rdquo; =&gt; &ldquo;/usr/bin/php-cgi&rdquo;,
&ldquo;socket&rdquo; =&gt; &ldquo;/tmp/php.socket&rdquo;
)))</div>
Exit and save the file.</p>

<p>Lets try starting Lighty:
<div class="console">lighttpd -f /home/lighttpd.conf
2009-01-27 15:02:20: (log.c.84) opening errorlog &lsquo;/var/log/lighttpd/error.log&rsquo; failed: No such file or directory
2009-01-27 15:02:20: (server.c.888) Opening errorlog failed. Going down.</div>
<div class="console">mkdir /var/log/lighttpd
touch /var/log/lighttpd/error.log; touch /var/log/lighttpd/access.log; chown -R dev:dev /var/log/lighttpd;</div>
Start lighty again and you&rsquo;re all set!</p>

<p>Now lets see if PHP worked&hellip;. browse to your dev server&rsquo;s ip and you should see the php info page, and all is well.</p>

<p><strong>Now lets get Ruby working</strong>
Now lets get Ruby-FCGI
<div class="console">wget <a href="http://sugi.nemui.org/pub/ruby/fcgi/ruby-fcgi-0.8.6.tar.gz">http://sugi.nemui.org/pub/ruby/fcgi/ruby-fcgi-0.8.6.tar.gz</a>; gunzip ruby-fcgi-0.8.6.tar.gz ; tar -xvf ruby-fcgi-0.8.6.tar;
cd ruby-fcgi-0.8.6
ruby install.rb config</div>
This fails so lets check for errors:
<div class="console">[root@localhost ruby-fcgi-0.8.6]# cat ext/fcgi/mkmf.log
have_header: checking for fcgiapp.h&hellip; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; no</p>

<hr />

<p>have_header: checking for fastcgi/fcgiapp.h&hellip; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; no</p>

<p>&ldquo;gcc -E -I. -I/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i386-linux -I/root/tmp/ruby-fcgi-0.8.6/ext/fcgi  -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector &ndash;param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -m32 -march=i386 -mtune=generic -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing  -fPIC  conftest.c -o conftest.i&rdquo;

checked program was:

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</div>
Fix:
<div class="console">wget <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz">http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz</a>; gunzip fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz; tar -xvf fcgi-2.4.0.tar; cd fcgi-2.4.0
./configure
make
make install</div>
Now lets try ruby again!
<div class="console">ruby install.rb config
ruby install.rb setup
ruby install.rb install</div>
Done :).</p>

<p>Now install gem: wget <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/45905/rubygems-1.3.1.tgz">http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/45905/rubygems-1.3.1.tgz</a></p>

<p>Gunzip, tar -xvf it and then compile it:</p>

<p>run <div class="console">ruby setup.rb</div></p>

<p>That should install Gem for you.</p>

<p>Next you need to install Rails, which can be done very easily now</p>

<div class="console">gem install rails</div>

<p>When initially doing this I ran into an issue of Rails complaining (specifically when running the ruby script/server command) about not being able to find the specific database information.</p>

<p>First: start a project</p>

<div class="console">cd /home/
mkdir ruby
cd ruby
rails demo
</div>

<p>That creates your first demo project.</p>

<p>Now lets make a controller:
<div class="console">ruby script/generate controller hello
      exists  app/controllers/
      exists  app/helpers/
      create  app/views/hello
      exists  test/functional/
      create  app/controllers/hello_controller.rb
      create  test/functional/hello_controller_test.rb
      create  app/helpers/hello_helper.rb
</div></p>

<p>Start the development server:</p>

<div class="console">ruby script/server
=> Booting Mongrel (use 'script/server webrick' to force WEBrick)
=> Rails 2.2.2 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Call with -d to detach
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
** Starting Mongrel listening at 0.0.0.0:3000
** Starting Rails with development environment...
** Rails loaded.
** Loading any Rails specific GemPlugins
** Signals ready.  TERM => stop.  USR2 => restart.  INT => stop (no restart).
** Rails signals registered.  HUP => reload (without restart).  It might not work well.
** Mongrel 1.1.5 available at 0.0.0.0:3000
** Use CTRL-C to stop.
</div>

<p>Browse to <a href="http://yourserverip:3000/hello">http://yourserverip:3000/hello</a>
Error:
 MissingSourceFile in HelloController#index</p>

<p>no such file to load &ndash; sqlite3</p>

<p>RAILS_ROOT: /home/ruby/demo</p>

<p>To fix:</p>

<p>Hit Ctrl+C to stop the web daemon, then:
<div class="console">cd config
nano database.yml
</div></p>

<p>Change it to read something like:
<div class="console">development:
  adapter: mysql
  encoding: utf8
  database: ruby
  username: root
  password: PASSWORD
</div></p>

<p>Now to install Ruby MySQL:
<div class="console">
gem install mysql &ndash; <br />
&ndash;with-mysql-include=/usr/include/mysql <br />
&ndash;with-mysql-lib=/usr/lib64/mysql
</div></p>

<p>Now try running the server again</p>

<div class="console">ruby script/server</div>

<p>and browse to <a href="http://yourserverip:3000/hello">http://yourserverip:3000/hello</a> and you should get another error:
Unknown action</p>

<p>No action responded to index. Actions:</p>

<p>To fix, first exit the web server (Ctrl+C), then:
<div class="console">cd app
cd controllers
nano hello_controller.rb</p>

<h1 id="change-file-to-look-like-this">Change file to look like this:</h1>

<p>class HelloController &lt; ApplicationController
   def index
      render :text =&gt; &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;
   end
end
</div></p>

<p>Save and exit, and then:
<div class="console">cd ../../;
ruby script/server</div></p>

<p>Browse to <a href="http://yourserverip:3000/hello">http://yourserverip:3000/hello</a></p>

<p>And voila, Rails! You should see: &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did however find a simpler way to run this using Mongrel:
<div class="code">gem install mongrel</div>
Wait a few for it to install and then just change to your demo directory:
<div class="console">mongrel_rails start -d</div></p>

<p><strong>Now to setup a Python (via Django)</strong>
<div class="console">wget <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.0.2/tarball/">http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.0.2/tarball/</a>
tar -xzvf Django-1.0.2-final.tar.gz
cd Django-1.0.2-final
python setup.py install</p>

<p>cd /home/
mkdir python
cd python
django-admin.py startproject demo
cd demo
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
</div></p>

<p>Browsing to <a href="http://yourserverip:8000/">http://yourserverip:8000/</a> you should see:</p>

<p>It worked!
Congratulations on your first Django-powered page.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re now all set up with one server that can serve PHP, Python, and Ruby pages.</p>

<p>This is by no means a programming tutorial, I was simply showing how to get the basics set up for people to start quickly learning PHP, Python (web programming), and Ruby on Rails.</p>
