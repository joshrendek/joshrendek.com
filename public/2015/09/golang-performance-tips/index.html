<p>Below is some advice and notes that I wish I had when writing Go to deal with high amounts of requests (20k+/second). Have any extra tips? Leave them in the comments!</p>

<h2 id="kernel-tuning">Kernel Tuning</h2>

<p>Step 1 is making sure your host OS isn&rsquo;t going to keel over when you start making thousands of requests/second or hammering the CPU.</p>

<p>Update <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> to have these lines:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 50000
</code></pre>

<p><code>ip_local_port_range</code> - at the default of 30,000 and not modifying the <code>tw_reuse</code> and <code>tw_recycle</code> properties, we&rsquo;re effectively limited to 500 connections/second to a server. If this is still not enough you can configure additional IP&rsquo;s on the server and cycle between them.</p>

<p><code>tcp_tw_reuse</code> will re-use an existing connection that is in <code>TIME-WAIT</code> for outgoing connections.</p>

<p><code>tcp_tw_recycle</code> enables sockets to be recycled faster once they reach the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state for both incoming and outgoing connections. Make sure you&rsquo;re not running anything through a NAT or this can cause problems with connections.</p>

<p><a href="http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux.html">Vinent Bernat</a> has a great explanation with state diagrams on his blog.</p>

<p>Next up are file descriptors. I prefer defining these in the init or upstart scripts, so you would call <code>ulimit -n 102400</code> and then call your go binary in the upstart script that way it is set before running. (Note: this will only work if the user has been properly given permissions to up their limit in <code>/etc/security/limits.d</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/Stanzas#limit">Upstart</a> also provides a mechanism to set file limits in the job stanza.</p>

<h2 id="golang-tuning">Golang Tuning</h2>

<h3 id="utilizing-all-cpus-go-1-5">Utilizing all CPUs ( &lt; Go 1.5 )</h3>

<p>You can use all the go-routines in the world and not use all your CPU cores and threads. In order to let your go program utilize all operating-system level threads, we need to tell the go runtime about them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU())
</code></pre>

<p>This is no longer necessary as of Go 1.5 and is done automatically.</p>

<h3 id="finish-what-you-start">Finish what you start</h3>

<p>Make sure you call <code>.Close()</code> on your responses, and make sure you read the entire body. The documentation for <code>net/http/response</code> explicitly says that &ldquo;it is the caller&rsquo;s responsibility to close Body&rdquo; and that &ldquo;neither ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.&rdquo; <a href="https://golang.org/src/net/http/response.go">net/http/response.go</a></p>

<h3 id="don-t-be-intimidated">Don&rsquo;t be intimidated</h3>

<p>You want to do things fast! But your confused by all the options for concurrency in go. Channels? Goroutines? Libraries to manage them? Stick with a simple worker pattern for best results. I&rsquo;ve found many libraries that claim to manage concurrency for you (limiting running routines, or providing some interface to queueing jobs) fall short, break, or not utilize all CPU cores.</p>

<p>Here is a simple worker pattern that uses nothing but the standard library:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">tasks := make(chan someDataStruct, 40)
var wg sync.WaitGroup

for i := 0; i &lt; 40; i++ {
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		for data := range tasks {
			// do some work on data
		}
		wg.Done()
	}()
}

// Push to it like this:
tasks &lt;- someData

// Finish like this
close(tasks)
wg.Wait()
</code></pre>

<p>First, we make a channel containing <code>someDataStruct</code> as the type to be sent/received over it. We give it a buffer size of 40. Since we only have 40 routines spinning up, no more than 40 can be worked on at once.</p>

<p>When a caller is trying to push data to this channel and all slots are full, it will block until a slot is free, so keep this in mind and change accordingly if you need to.</p>

<p>Next we make a <code>WaitGroup</code> which will wait for all of our goroutines to finish. When we loop 40 times and say <code>wg.Add(1)</code> we&rsquo;re telling the <code>WaitGroup</code> that we&rsquo;re expecting 40 goroutines, and to wait for them to finish.</p>

<p>Next we iterate over data coming in our <code>tasks</code> channel and do some process on it (this is obviously where your program specific logic or function calls go).</p>

<p>When no more data is available on the channel we call <code>wg.Done()</code> which tells the <code>WaitGroup</code> a routine has finished.</p>

<p>Pushing data is simple by passing an instance of <code>someDataStruct</code> into the <code>tasks</code> channel.</p>

<p>Almost done! We now want to wait for everything to finish before our program exits. <code>close(tasks)</code> marks the channel as closed - and any other callers who try and send to it will get a nice fat error message.</p>

<p>Finally <code>wg.Wait()</code> says to wait until all 40 <code>wg.Done()</code>&rsquo;s have been called.</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>

<p>One of my favorite things about go is that its fast, real fast. Make sure you test, test, and test some more! Always make sure you fail gracefully (if a HTTP connection failed and you need to re-process a job, for instance) and push jobs back onto their queues when a failure is detected. If you have an unexpected race condition or other errors (run out of file descriptors, etc) go will very quickly churn through your job queue.</p>

<h3 id="but-what-about">But what about&hellip;</h3>

<p>There are lots of other considerations, like what you&rsquo;re running this against. On small elasticsearch clusters using these patterns to send data from go daemons to ES, I&rsquo;ve been able to hit 50k requests/second with still plenty of room to grow.</p>

<p>You may need to pay extra attention to what libraries your using: how many redis connections can you have open? How many do you need?</p>

<p>Are you using keep-alive connections for HTTP? Is your receiver setup properly (nginx configs, etc)?</p>

<p>Is your MySQL or PostgreSQL server tuned to allow this many connections? Make sure you use connection pooling!</p>

<h3 id="lastly-monitor-all-the-things">Lastly: Monitor all the things!</h3>

<p>Send your data somewhere. I prefer StatsD, InfluxDB and Grafana for my monitoring stack. There is a ready-to-use go library <a href="https://github.com/quipo/statsd">quipo/statsd</a> that I haven&rsquo;t had issues with. One important thing to do is throw any data sends into a goroutine otherwise you might notice a slowdown while it tries to send the data.</p>

<p>Whether you use Grafana or anything else, its important to monitor. Without metrics on how your systems are running (ops/s, latency, etc) you have no insight into whether or not new changes have affected the overall throughput of your system.</p>
