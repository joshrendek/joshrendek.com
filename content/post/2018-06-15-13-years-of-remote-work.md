In one form or another I've worked remotely since 2005 (with a brief mix of remote/onsite for about 2 years).  I'm going to put together a list below of the things I've found that are instrumental in having a succesful remote work life and ensuring you join a great remote team.

Why I like working remote


Personal

* Have a dedicated work environment or quite space
* Work on having a routine
* Figure out your work styles - do you prefer pairing? working with music? working with a show on in the background? silence? outside?


Professional

Do's:

* Work on good communication habits.
*


Dont's:

* Don't subject your coworkers to your local coffee/food shops background noise
* Don't hyper-interpret text. I like to believe people are helpful, so don't take text the wrong way.
