title: Servly - What I've been busy with...

I originally wrote Servly to be a service where people would register and have their own personal accounts on a server. I've redesigned this and done a 180 and plan on making it a solution hosted by whoever uses it on their own hardware (although I may release a shared version for people to use as a software as a service... or may only release it as that, not sure yet).

There's been a lot of work that has gone into this and it's still quite a bit from being done but it has a lot of nice features such as aggregate overviews of all servers as well as a network graph (easily pick up on incoming DDOS's graphically and respond instantly).

Let me know if you have any feature ideas!
