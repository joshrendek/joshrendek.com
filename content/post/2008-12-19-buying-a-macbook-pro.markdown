So I'm planning on purchasing a shiny new Macbook Pro 2.4 ghz 2GB ram 15" screen and the 250GB 7200 RPM HDD. I was going to pick it up in store, so I first called one location. After being put on hold about 5 times while she figured out what "250GB @ 7200 rpm" meant, she said they didn't have that model in store.

So I called the second store - she informed me that they carry ZERO upgraded models in store. So if I wanted to get the base 2.4GHz macbook pro with an upgraded HDD, I couldn't find this in the store. Ever. Or the 2.5 GHz model with a 7200 RPM HDD, order online. Basically anything but the stock model I'd have to order online.

Needless to say I'm now just ordering online instead of going to the store since they have free 2 day shipping. Can anyone else confirm this
