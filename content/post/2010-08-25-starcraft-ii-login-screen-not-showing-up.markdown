Couldn't figure out why my Starcraft II wasn't letting me login (or show up) on my desktop (but was on laptop): Go ~ Documents / Blizzard / Starcraft II

Make a new folder called tmp (or just move it all to the trash) and move the folders and everything in there inside that folder. Load the game and all your settings should be reset and the login screen should show up again.
