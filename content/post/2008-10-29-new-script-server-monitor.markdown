I've been writing a new program for monitoring servers ( I havn't found one that was easy to setup and didn't require some painful process to setup server / remote side ). It consists of the monitoring machine where all the remote servers report to. The remote servers run a simple PHP scripts every 5 minutes that reports to the monitor.

Here are a few screen shots, let me know if you'd like to see more or learn more.
