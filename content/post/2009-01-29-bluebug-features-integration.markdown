I'm working on some new features for BlueBug and one of them is a bit of integration, for instance to link to a ClientExec support ticket you just do [ce]1234[/ce] where 1234 is the ticket ID. Each project can have it's own CE URL. I've also done the same with GitHub so [git]commitID[/git] will open up the page for the commit.

Would anyone like to see more If so what program (if its commercial please give me an example URL).
