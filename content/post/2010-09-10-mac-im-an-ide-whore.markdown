I don't know if I've posted about how many IDE's I use but I'm always switching between TextMate/RubyMine and several others. I will say that I have been sticking more with the Java variant IDEs though since I got my Mac Pro with an SSD.... it makes uber-slow Java apps actually run at a near native speed.
