ssh -ND 9999 user@host.com

Open firefox, network preferences under the Advanced tab, SOCKS proxy and set host to 127.0.0.1 and port 9999 close preferences and you're all set to go.

-- Addendum:

I was actually at Panera's doing some work while I ate breakfast with a friend when I did this... I had planned on staying longer but apparently Panera's doesn't like customers buying lunch... I had planned on staying an additional bit past 12 to eat some lunch there but was promptly disconnected from the internet after 30 minutes of use (between 11:30AM and 1:30PM they block you after 30 minutes of WiFi).

Panera's you've lost my business.
